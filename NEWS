VERSION 1.1.4
------------------------
 o Fixed bug in coveragePlot - github Issue 15:
     Previously function cleaned the beginning of each peptide sequence by 
gsub("^\[.\]\.([A-Z]+)\.\[.\]$", "\1", .). However, it is not always the case
that the terminal amino acids are surround by square brackets. I have put a 
more general regex in place that removes everything up to the first '.' and
everything after the last '.'. 

VERSION 1.1.3
------------------------
'ImmunoOncology' added to BiocViews.

VERSION 1.1.2
------------------------
Updates to vignette to avoid build errors when attempting to connect to Uniprot

VERSION 1.1.1
------------------------
 o Fixed bug in maVolPlot - github Issue 12:
    Previously the 'selectedGenes' argument used GeneSymbols to match genes to
highlight in the plot. Not all accessions are annotated with a GeneSymbol, and 
some GeneSymbols are linked to more than one Accession. This could lead to 
situations where incorrect genes were being highlighted due to duplicate 
entries or NAs. The function now accepts and matches to accessions instead - 
this is now noted in the man pages.
 o Fixed bug in convertToMSnset - github Issue 11:
    The function previously threw and error if the metadata was a tibble as it
needs to set row names. The function now tranforms the metadata object to a
data frame.
